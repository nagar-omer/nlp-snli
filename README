IMPORTANT FOLDERS:
Report:
    this folder
    - report.pdf        our report describing our work
    - nohup.out         this the output of the training process
    - test_model.pred   this is the prediction for  "snli_1.0_test.txt"

run:
    this folder contain two files
    - train_new_model.py            program to train new model
    - pred_with_existing_model.py   a program to test a snli-data-file using a trained model


BEFORE RUNNING:
    the article we implemented, use a GloVe 300 dim embedding vectors
    moreover its model contains 12M variables thus we couldn't upload our trained model (not even to a Git-repository)

    download
        - SNLI data-set :: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/snli_1.0.zip
        - Glove vectors :: http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip            (use "glove.6B.300d.txt" file)


TRAINING A NEW MODEL
    go to run folder and run the following commands
        - python train_new_model.py   MODEL_NAME    PRE_TRAINED_SRC     TRAIN_SRC      DEV_SRC
        e.g.
        - python train_new_model.py   my-model    glove.6B.300d.txt     snli_1.0_train.txt      snli_1.0_dev.txt

        after running this command the training process will begin, a trained model pickle called
        MODEL_NAME.trained_model will be saved under pkl directory


PREDICTING USING AN EXISTING MODEL
    go to run folder and run the following commands
        - python pred_with_existing_model.py MODEL_NAME TEST_SRC
    e.g.
        - python pred_with_existing_model.py   my-model    snli_1.0_test.txt

    the program will create 2 files
    - prediction file
    - loss and accuracy files

    NOTE - the model file must stay in the pkl folder

the program runs over the GPU, this parameter and all other parameters can be tuned from utils/params.py file
